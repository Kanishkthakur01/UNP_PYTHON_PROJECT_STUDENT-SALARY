# UNP_PYTHON_PROJECT_STUDENT-SALARY
I would like to sincerely thank the UNP members for their invaluable guidance and support throughout this project. Their expertise and encouragement greatly contributed to its successful completion.

Description
The project focused on predicting engineering graduate salaries using machine learning techniques. Key tasks included data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover factors influencing salaries, such as academic performance, skills, and personality traits. Classification models like Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Trees were implemented, with Logistic Regression achieving the highest accuracy of 71.05%. Visualizations such as histograms, bar plots, and heatmaps were used for insights, while handling missing values and categorical encoding enhanced data quality. The project demonstrated practical applications of Python for data analysis and model evaluation in real-world scenarios.
